            Located in the Kamrup district of Assam, 18 km southwest of Guwahati city, Dipor Bil (also spelt Deepor
            Beel) is a
            freshwater lake in the former channel of the Brahmaputra river. Sprawling over a vast area of 40 sq. km, the
            lake was
            declared as a Bird Sanctuary in 1989 owing to its rich biodiversity and heritage. Home to a vast variety of
            exotic bird
            species, Dipor Bil is a major tourist attraction of Assam. Well known for its pristine beauty and
            biodiversity, the area
            offers a spectacular view of the fascinating wetland and rich forest ecosystem. As many as 19000 different
            species of
            rare and endangered birds can be seen every day at the spot, which draws tourists in hordes from far and
            wide.

            In 2002, Ramsar Convention listed it as a Ramsar site due to its vast variety of flora and fauna and its
            wetland
            characteristic. Winter season is the best time to visit the spot as the weather conditions attract
            hibernating birds
            from far west and south countries. Considering the density and diversity of breeds flocking the place
            annually, Birdlife
            International has also declared it as Important Bird Area (IBA) and adequate measures are taken to preserve
            the rich
            culture and environs.

            Dipor Bil boasts of an enormous variety of flora and fauna, rich biodiversity and varied wildlife. The
            lakeside has
            divergent species of plants- water hyacinths, water lilies, aquatic grasses, marshy lands and vegetation
            patches. As per
            research 18 varieties of phytoplanktons have been found at the site. Also, rare plants like Euryale Ferox,
            potamogeton
            crispus etc have been spotted.

            Needless to mention, Dipor Bil is a proud abode of a sweeping number of very rare and endangered birds.
            Harbouring close
            to 19000 birds on a single day basis, the lake is a dwelling of approx 220 bird species out of which 70 are
            migratory.
            Some endangered birds found here include Spot Billed Pelican, Lesser Adjutant Stork, White Bellied Eagle,
            Siberian Crane
            etc. A total of 20 amphibians, 12 lizards, 18 snakes, 6 turtle and tortoise species have been listed here.
            Considering
            the aforementioned factors, the area attracts a lot of researchers, students and wildlife photographers
            other than the
            regular tourists.
